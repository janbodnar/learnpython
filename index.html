        <h2>About Python</h2>

        <p>
            Python is a general-purpose, dynamic, object-oriented programming language. The design purpose of the
            Python
            language emphasizes programmer productivity and code readability. Python was initially developed by Guido
            van
            Rossum. It was first released in 1991. Python was inspired by ABC, Haskell, Java, Lisp, Icon, and Perl
            programming languages. Python is a high-level, general purpose, multi-platform, interpreted language.
        </p>

        <p>
            Python is a minimalistic language. One of its most visible features is that it does not use semicolons nor
            brackets; Python uses indentation instead.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are two main branches of Python currently: Python 2.x and Python 3.x. Python 3.x breaks backward
            compatibility with previous releases of Python. It was created to correct some design flaws of the language
            and
            make it more clean. This tutorial covers Python 3.x version. Today, Python is maintained by a large group
            of
            volunteers worldwide. Python is open source software.
        </p>

        <p>
            Python supports several programming styles. It does not force a programmer to a specific paradigm. It
            supports
            procedural, object oriented, and functional programming.
